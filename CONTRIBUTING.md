#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

For example, start by explaining how you started AGIC Installer, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started AGIC Installer otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an AGIC Installer command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.


Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Azure CLI are you using?
